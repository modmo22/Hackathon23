# Hackathon23
Hackathon Project: Browser-based game for elementary to middle school-aged children that teaches basic principles of coding in Python.

This project was started by Seth Daniels, Brady Holland, Mo Morgan, and Gil Vandegrift for the 2023 KU Hackathon. While we weren't able to achieve a minimum viable product, 
we have decided to continue to work on this project beyond the scope of the Hackathon. While the project repository is housed on Mo's Github account, this project's IP is
owned by the aforementioned.
